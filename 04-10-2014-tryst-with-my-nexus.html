                 <h3>5 minutes before the tragedy</h3>
                 <p>One fine day, I was texting my friend on the FB messenger app. I keep my dear nexus on the bed. And go to freshen up. I come back and see it's switched off <span class="text-muted" style="font-size:12px;">( play dramatic music. )</span>. Has it ever happened to you that you leave her for 5 mins and she has just turned off? ;)
                 </p>
                 <h3>Research</h3>
                 <p>
                    I didn't know what to do. I pressed the power button. There came the google logo. And then again. And again. Aaaaand again. <br/>
                    Kids. This phenomena is called boot loop, may also be a soft brick.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    After googling it for possible solutions and from the advice of my awesome friends on facebook, I found that either my phone was bricked for which I needed to go to recovery mode and do some changes or the power button was screwed up. 
                 </p>
                 <h3>Flashback!</h3>
                 <p>
                    Now some quick background on my dear nexus. </br>
                    It was bought in the states via play store. Hence warranty was not applicable here, in India, even though I was well within the warranty period.</br>
                    Sending it to States would prove costly, but this was the last resort.
                    The phone was rooted. Hence in the bootloader menu it showed that it was unlocked. <span class="text-muted" style="font-size:12px">-_- Why you little.</span>
                 </p>

                 <h3>Being Sherlock</h3>
                 <p>
                    I tried going to the bootloader to clear dalvik cache just in case it was a soft brick. But in the menu before I could go to the recovery mode, it used to automatically select (power button is used for selecting.) whatever was on screen within a second. This lead me to think it may have been a faulty power button. Elementry, my dear Watson.

                    
                    <span class="caption text-muted" >( source : giphy.com )</span>
                    <iframe class="center-block" src="http://giphy.com/embed/yr6mgdF0b9arC?html5=true" width="500" height="281" frameBorder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>

                    <br/> It's here where I decided to go to the LG service center. 
                 </p> 

                 <h3>Visiting LG 'self' service center.</h3>  
                 <p>
                    So I found this big LG service center. This rekindled the lost spirit in me. Showed him the problem. And before I finished telling him everything he cuts me and says, "Nothing I can do Saar. It's yemerican model. I can change the motherboard which will cost you 12 grand rupees. Or you send this there." I rebeled, "Listen to the problem, it might be a faulty power button". He was quite a rebel too, "Eh no man. My brother in law also had same problem, he also asked me to do something. I sent him off to U.S.A."
                    </br>
                    Now thoroughly confused whether to send my phone or myself to the states I went to a local shop who said he was busy day and night as his marriage was around the corner. I didn't even want so much detail.
                    I went to another LG <b>'do it yourself'</b> service center. Who kept my phone for a week and returned it saying the same thing. "Motherboard gone Sir. Replace and give me 12k cash."
                    <span class="caption text-muted" >( source : giphy.com )</span>
                    <iframe class="center-block" src="http://giphy.com/embed/10EdqIfzllpg6A?html5=true" width="500" height="281" frameBorder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>
                    <span class="caption text-muted" class="center-block">Exactly Ryan. Exactly.</span>
                 </p>

                 <h3>The Temptation</h3>
                 <p> This is where I feel a little guilty with myself. I for a second thought of paying 12k and not work more to solve a problem at hand. And when I realised it only gave me 3 months warranty, I set my eyes on Moto X for a while. But then something happened. My Nexus 5 got jealous.</p>

                <h3 id = "solution">Haaallelujah!</h3>
                <p>
                    Sitting in Krespy kreme, I was requested to display my friends the demo of my faulty nexus. Turning phone away from me I switched it on. Counted till three and said "and now it restarts." <br/>Only it didn't.
                    I had pressed the area behind the camera and the power button to hear a click previously. It was working somehow. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    I ran to the car, got my mac. Recovered important data, cleared dalvik cache, did a factory reset. Downloaded stock image and unrooted the phone. Updated it to 4.4.4. And now it works fine. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    So the culprit? Mostly the faulty power button. Give your nexus a tight slap if it misbehaves and doesn't let you choose something from the bootloader menu. That should do. 
                    Also add "Somebody gonna get a hurt real bad" to give some style and scare your phone into working.
