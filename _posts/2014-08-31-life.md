Erm. 

###System.out.println("Hello world!");

Yeah yeah, overused, trying so hard to be a geek, yada yada. kill(your_process_id, SIGQUIT); 

What you read here is mostly going to be about things which seem very interesting to me, mostly computer science related, or things which bother me, hopefully along with the possible solutions for them. You shall also find me giving some random "wisdom" talk here and there, so those who are wiser, kindly ignore/ leave comments and let me learn too from thy awesomeness. 

##Why do people write blogs?

Hmm, to express an idea? To discuss new ideas? To criticize ones' ideas? 
For many it's a place to vomit their opinion. Their ideology. Their wisdom.

See you around.
